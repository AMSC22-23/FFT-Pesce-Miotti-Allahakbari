The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental algorithm in signal processing, widely utilized for efficiently computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence. Originally developed by Cooley and Tukey in the 1960s, FFT has become a cornerstone in various scientific and engineering applications, including image processing, audio analysis, telecommunications, and many others. This report provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the implementation of FFT, discussing key concepts, algorithms, and considerations in the context of a specific implementation. In this project both FFT and DFT algorithms were implemented using different approaches and numerous solutions was used to improve its performance. After all the optimizations an application of this algorithm (Image compression) is demonstrated.
