## 1. Introduction
This project is composed by two main parts: the efficient, parallel implementation of the fast Fourier transform, and a set of applications that use it, namely a simplified version of the JPEG compression algorithm and the wavelet transform.

The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). The DFT is a mathematical transformation that decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies. It is used in many fields, such as signal processing or image processing, and it is the basis of many compression algorithms, such as JPEG.

This report will focus on three main aspects: the parallelization and optimization of the two dimensional FFT, the implementation of the JPEG compression algorithm, and the implementation of the wavelet transform.
