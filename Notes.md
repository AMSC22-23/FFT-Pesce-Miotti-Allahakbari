# Some comments #

The code is well done and in good modern c++. I have no major comments on the code itself. I would have liked to see more comments in the code, but I understand that this is a small project and the code is pretty self explanatory.

In general, however, I would encourage to write comemnts using Doxygen, as it is a very good way to document code and it is very easy to use.

I have written very few comments in the source, indicated be @bote.

The code compiels fine and runs. In the presentation focus on your architectural choices and the design of the code, as well as results.
